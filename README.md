# Fare Finder

Build a SaaS landing page + authenticated app shell for Flight Price Notifier (機票降價通知), a product that watches popular flight routes from Taipei and emails the user when the cheapest fare drops to or below their target price — targeted at budget-driven travelers who don't care exactly when they fly, they just want a ticket under their budget.

The site must include:

A public landing page (/) with:

Hero section: product name "Flight Price Notifier" prominently displayed, value prop 「設定航線與目標價，機票降價就通知你」 (English subtitle: "Set a route and a target price — we email you when the fare drops."), and a primary CTA button labeled "Sign in / 登入" in the top-right header.
Features section with exactly 3 feature cards:
Card 1: 「盯緊熱門航線 (Always-on route watching)」 — 持續監控台北出發的熱門航線（東京、首爾），自動抓最低票價。
Card 2: 「達標自動通知 (Target-price email alerts)」 — 低於你設定的目標價，就寄 email 提醒你，附上立即訂購連結。
Card 3: 「隨時取消 (Cancel anytime)」 — 月訂閱制，不想用隨時停，沒有綁約。
Footer with copyright 「© 2026 Flight Price Notifier」.
Authentication using Supabase Auth on the user-owned Supabase project (`wvzrjguaerlzdxrtuubf`):

Sign Up page with email + password
Sign In page with email + password
Sign Out functionality
Email confirmation can be disabled for simplicity in this v1
An authenticated app shell at /app that the user lands on after signing in:

Greets the signed-in user by email: 「Hi {user.email}」
A placeholder message: 「你的航線追蹤儀表板即將上線 — 下一個里程碑會加上訂閱航線的功能。」 (English: "Your dashboard is coming soon. Route-subscription will be added in the next milestone.")
A Sign Out button in the header
Design requirements:

Modern, professional dark theme (purple/violet accent on a near-black background)
Use Inter or a similar sans-serif font
Mobile responsive
Tasteful subtle animations (fade-in on scroll is fine; don't overdo it)
Out of scope for this v1: route-subscription form, target-price input, fare display, payment, custom database tables (do NOT create a subscriptions or profiles table — only use Supabase's default auth.users). Those come in later milestones. Stick to landing page + auth + placeholder dashboard.

This project was built with [Lovable](https://lovable.dev).

## Build with Lovable

Continue developing this project in the [Lovable editor](https://lovable.dev/projects/cf5f6d6c-8acd-4213-87bd-877a33e84abe).

- **Ship faster**: describe what you want to build and Lovable handles the code.
- **Stay in sync**: every change made in Lovable is committed straight to this repository.
- **Full ownership**: this code is yours. Push to `main` on GitHub and your changes sync back into Lovable, ready for your next prompt.

## Development

This is a plain **Vite + React single-page app** (no SSR). Routing is client-side with React Router.

```sh
bun install        # or npm install
bun run dev        # http://localhost:5173
bun run build      # static output in dist/
bun run preview    # serve dist/ locally (with SPA fallback)
```

Environment variables (see `.env`): only `VITE_*` variables are exposed to the browser bundle. The backend is the user-owned Supabase project `wvzrjguaerlzdxrtuubf`.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Supabase publishable key (`sb_publishable_…`, replaces the legacy anon key) |

### Routes

| Path | Page |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Landing page |
| `/sign-in` | Sign in |
| `/sign-up` | Create account |
| `/auth` | Redirects to `/sign-in` |
| `/app` | Dashboard (signed-in users only; others are sent to `/sign-in`) |

## Deploying to Vercel

Import the repo in Vercel — `vercel.json` sets the framework to Vite, the build command to `vite build` and the output directory to `dist/`, and rewrites every path to `index.html` so deep links like `/app` load the SPA and resolve client-side. Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` as Vercel environment variables (they are inlined at build time).

In Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration, add your Vercel domain to the Site URL / redirect URLs so sign-up confirmation emails link back correctly.
